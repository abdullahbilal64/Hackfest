RemoteCon

Motivation:
The project was created as part of the competition posted by Remotebase and the project is intended to be used as a social media for the employees of Remotebase. AsRemotebase consists of a large workforce working remotely, this project is intended to become as a platform where employees of the company may be able to socialise with each other. 

Frameworks Used:
To succecfully implement this project, we used a number of frameworks that includes express.js for deployement, node.js for server side development and react.js for client side development. Along with this we integrated Mongo.db using mongoose.js for database integration.

Features:
RemoteCon acts as a social media application for employees of Remotebase where they can share different aspects of their lives. Our app aims to solve the issue regarding employees working remotely having to compromise their social work life. To solve these problems we have integrated the functionality of social media where employees can post to their feed and their fellow employees can react to these posts. To promote users to actively participate in work related social activities, we also devised a point based system through which the employees participating the most may recieve gifts as well. Other than this, employees can chat with each other in groups as well as one to one. To establish more camaraderie among the employees, we also intend to integrate online games where employees can have a friendly game with each other. The platform also intends to provide a platform where employees can organise meet-ups with each other depending on the areas they live in.
